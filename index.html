        <p>In a world eager for definitions, they remain a quiet anomaly—engineer by training, philosopher by instinct. With roots in the study of transformation and decay, they see systems not as tools, but as mirrors reflecting the impermanence of structure and certainty.</p>

        <p>Their skills move fluidly through logic and abstraction, resisting the urge to arrive. Code, models, mechanisms—all are invitations to question, not conclude. To watch them work is to sense thought folding in on itself, searching not for answers, but for the shape of the question.</p>
